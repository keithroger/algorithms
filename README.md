### **Shortest Path**

| Algorithm | Complexity | Description |
| --- | --- | ---
| **Dijkstra’s** | O(E*log(V)) | Shortest path from one vertex to all vertices. Requires non-negative edge weights.
| **Bellman–Ford** | O(V*E) | Finds the shortest path from one vertex to all vertices.
| **Floyd Warshall** | O(V^3) | Shortest path between all vertices. Can handle negative values.
