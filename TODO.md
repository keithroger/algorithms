# TODO

## General
- Make folder for algorithms and examples
- Make code work with generics
- Make stack/queue into iterators

## README.md
- List algorithms
    - Create links to view code
    - Note what they are good for
    - Note examples of the algorithm being used
    - Note the time they take
    - Note the memory used
    - List variations and why they can be used
- Display performance on graph
    - Show performance on different kinds of data
        - reversed
        - many common items
        - all the same item
        - mostly in order

## Testing
- Have testing test different sorting cases
    - empty list
    - reversed list
    - random slice
    - all the same value
    - many of the same values

## Algorithms to Impliment
- quicksort
- quicksort for many identical values
- merge sort
- examples
    - math equation parser
    - union find
- heap priority que

## Ideas
- Show algorithm writen out in a markdown code block
