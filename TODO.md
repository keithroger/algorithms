# TODO

## General
- Make folder for algorithms and examples
- Make code work with generics
- Make stack/queue into iterators

## README.md
- List algorithms
    - Create links to view code
    - Note what they are good for
    - Note examples of the algorithm being used
    - Note the time they take
- Display performance on graph

## Ideas
- Show algorithm writen out in a markdown code block
